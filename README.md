# Copilot Reflection - my own Hydration Tracker app
I incorporated Copilot into my design and coding process by using detailed comments to generate code and the chat feature to develop my app. One example of how I edited Copilots suggestion was by adding fomratting to the main page of the app. Copilots suggestion had buttons going off the screen, and everything right along the edges. This was not visually appealing so I asked it to move some of the items and add padding. One example of how Copilot significantly sped up my work was by adding the edit and delete feature for water intake in seconds. I asked Copilot to add this capability and everything was correct with it and I didn't have to change or edit anything. This was very helpful because this feature would take me a long time to develop on my own.
